Configure your users to use Product Catalog Management and assign permission sets so that the users can access catalogs, products, attributes, rules, context definitions, product bundles, and more. To complete the setup of Product Catalog Management, adjust the page layout and field access on the product object.

*   **[Organize Your Products with Catalogs and Categories](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ind.product_catalog_catalogs.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**<br>A catalog is a collection of the products that you sell, organized into categories for easier browsing.

Define attributes once, and let subclassifications automatically inherit them, while still allowing you to manually override attributes as needed. Product classifications help you maintain data consistency and reduce repetitive manual tasks, allowing you to quickly define and launch products with shared characteristics.
*   **[Create Products and Product Bundles in Revenue Cloud](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ind.product_catalog_products.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**<br>Products are all the items and services that you sell to customers.

*   **[Product Catalog Management Limits](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ind.product_catalog_product_catalog_management_limits.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**<br>Before you plan and create products, attributes, and a bundled product hierarchy in Product Catalog Management, make sure that you’re aware of the capabilities and limits.
