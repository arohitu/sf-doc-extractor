# Place Sales Transaction (POST)

Create a sales transaction, such as an order or a quote, with integrated pricing and configuration. Additionally, update an order or a quote, and insert and delete order or quote line items to calculate the estimated tax.

You can also group order or quote line items based on location, work types, or departments, if groups are enabled for your org. Groups provide a visualization of the products to view large quotes.

You can add up to 1000 quote line items for a quote, and 1000 order products for an order. For complex flows that involve a large volume of records, ensure that the number of line items that are sent to this API are within this limit.
